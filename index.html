  <h1>Brooklyn Web Workers is a monthly tech meetup and variety show, coming sometime this August.</h1>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Brooklyn Web Workers is organized and hosted by Justin Falcone. Previously, Justin was a co-organizer of BrooklynJS and Write to Speak.</li>
    <li>Brooklyn Web Workers follows the JSConf Code of Conduct.</li>
    <li>We’re still nailing down a venue, but it will likely be the back room of a bar in Brooklyn, with around 50 people in the audience.</li>
    <li>The format of the show is 3x 10 minute lighting talks and 1x 20 minute “headliner”, with musical interludes in between.</li>
    <li>The event is geared towards people who write code for a living, but is not targeted at any particular tech stack. Our community is not defined by what language or frameworks we use, but by our shared experience working in the tech industry and living in New York. The technical content of the talks should be understandable to a broad software engineering audience, like the talks at BangBangCon or Deconstruct.</li>
    <li>The tech industry is deeply enmeshed in the social and political turmoil in the United States — social media, AI, mass surveillance — but other tech events avoid these topics, or engage with them only on a superficial, “apolitical” level. At Brooklyn Web Workers, these topics are discussed explicitly, politically, and frequently.</li>
    <li>There are no sponsors or sponsees; the event is funded by ticket sales and the organizers. Speakers get a +1, drink tickets and travel expenses. Musical guests are paid.</li>
  </ul>
